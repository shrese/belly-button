# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this module was to create an interactive website that interacts with the belly button dataset that was given.  We were to create the following charts:
* Horizontal
* Bubble
* Guage

We were also to add some customization.  I included:
* An image on the jumbotron
* Various changes to the font from size, bold, and font type
* Changes to margins and charts so that they fit evenly on the page
* Added breaks so that there is space between charts
* Added color to the background and other features of the site
* Added a boarder to one of the items in the site


## Summary
I could have spent a lot more time on the development of this site.  I have really enjoyed this module and look forward to more web development.

Potential upgrades to site:
1. A legend or decoder ring that explained the abbreviated terms.
2. A summary of what the data is telling us.
3. More analysis around the data in the .json file including but not limited to age, ethnicity, and location.
4. And so...so much more.

footnote: I tried to get the margins of my demographic data to align with the heading, but failed.
